# Fashion Trends Web App

This is a web application that tracks and visualizes fashion trends over time and by region using the **Google Trends API**. The frontend is built with **TypeScript** and features an interactive map powered by **Leaflet.js**, while the backend is powered by **Python (Flask)** to query the Google Trends API and return results.
